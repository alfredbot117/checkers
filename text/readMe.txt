The files will be store in XAMPP 

XAMPP is primarily used for hosting web applications locally on
your machine. To open files using XAMPP, here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Install XAMPP: First, ensure that you have XAMPP installed on your 
   computer. You can download it from the official website of Apache 
   Friends (https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html). Follow the 
   installation instructions provided on their website for your specific 
   operating system.

2. Start XAMPP Control Panel: After installation, start the XAMPP Control 
  Panel. Depending on your OS, you can find the control panel application 
  or use the XAMPP control interface from the XAMPP folder.

3. Start Apache Server: In the XAMPP Control Panel, click on the "Start"
   button next to the Apache server. This action initiates the Apache server, 
   allowing you to access files within the htdocs directory.

4. Access Localhost: Open your web browser and type "localhost" in the address 
   bar. This should take you to the XAMPP dashboard or the root directory of 
   the web server.

5. Access Files in htdocs: By default, XAMPP hosts files in the htdocs directory.
   Navigate to the htdocs directory within your XAMPP installation folder. Place 
   the files you want to access in this directory.

6. Access Files via the Browser: To open a file in your browser, type the file path 
   relative to the htdocs directory in your browser's address bar. For example, if 
   your file is named "myfile.html" and is located directly inside htdocs, you would
   type: http://localhost/myfile.html. Adjust the URL according to your file structure.
